In advance of the Women in Data Science (WiDS) Stanford Conference to be held on March 8, 2023, we invite you to build a team, hone your data science skills, and join us for the 6th Annual WiDS Datathon focused on social impact. In this yearâ€™s datathon challenges participants will use data science to improve longer-range weather forecasts to help people prepare and adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change.

The WiDS Datathon encourages women worldwide to hone their data science skills, creating a supportive environment for women to connect with others in their community who share their interests. Data scientists of all levels are invited to participate in the datathon, including beginners.
